# Work log

## 2026-09-07 — Initial implementation session

Implemented React/TypeScript management screens, 13 leagues and 137 clubs, 1,812 real-name player records plus generated players, season simulation, tactics, negotiations and transfers, coaching and training, finances, and versioned D1 career persistence.

Initial history is grouped by implementation area: application foundation; league/player data; game engine; API/database; interface; verification/documentation. These groups belong to this session and do not represent invented earlier sessions.

Validation completed before the repository handoff:

- Production build succeeded.
- Four game invariant tests passed, covering every club, league scheduling, a complete season transition, and management transactions.
- All eight Node tests passed, including the SSR smoke test and UI primitive semantics. The SSR smoke test stubs only the Cloudflare module import; it does not verify D1 persistence.
- No browser verification or deployed persistence verification performed.
- Standalone TypeScript checking still requires generated Cloudflare runtime declarations for `cloudflare:workers`, `Fetcher`, and `D1Database`.

Known scope: common league rules; partial real rosters outside MLB/NPB; game-generated ratings/contracts; simplified pitching and postseason formats. See README for details.
